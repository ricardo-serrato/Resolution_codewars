# # 7 kyu| The First Non Repeated Character In A String | https://www.codewars.com/kata/570f6436b29c708a32000826/python
# DESCRIPTION:
# You need to write a function, that returns the first non-repeated character in the given string.

# If all the characters are unique, return the first character of the string.
# If there is no unique character, return null in JS or Java, None in Python, '\0' in C.

# You can assume, that the input string has always non-zero length.

# Examples
# "test"   returns "e"
# "teeter" returns "r"
# "trend"  returns "t" (all the characters are unique)
# "aabbcc" returns null (all the characters are repeated)


def first_non_repeated(s):
    d = {}
    
    for char in s:
        if char not in d:
            d[char] = 1
            
        else:
            d[char] += 1

    for c,v in d.items():
        if v == 1:
            return c
    return None
