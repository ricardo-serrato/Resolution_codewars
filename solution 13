# Title: Isograms| Codewars
# DESCRIPTION: https://www.codewars.com/kata/54ba84be607a92aa900000f1/python 
# An isogram is a word that has no repeating letters, consecutive or non-consecutive. Implement a function that determines whether a string that contains only letters is an isogram. Assume the empty string is an isogram. Ignore letter case.

# Example: (Input --> Output)

# "Dermatoglyphics" --> true "aba" --> false "moOse" --> false (ignore letter case)

# isIsogram "Dermatoglyphics" = true
# isIsogram "moose" = false
# isIsogram "aba" = false

def is_isogram(string):
    new_set = set()
    
    for word in string:
        word = word.lower()
        if word in new_set:
            return False
        new_set.add(word)
        
    return True
